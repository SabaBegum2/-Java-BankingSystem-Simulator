# -Java-BankingSystem-Simulator

Welcome to Java-BankingSystem-Simulator, a Java project designed to simulate basic operations of a banking system. 
This repository features a BankAccount class which allows users to interact with a simulated bank account through a console-based menu. 
The program provides functionalities like creating accounts, displaying account details, and basic transaction operations.

Key Features:

Interactive Menu: Offers a user-friendly console menu to navigate through different banking operations.

Account Management: Facilitates creating and displaying bank account details, providing a fundamental understanding of how banking 
systems manage client information.

Search and Transaction Functions: Includes placeholder methods for searching accounts and conducting deposit and withdrawal operations,
illustrating the typical functionalities of a banking application.

Fundamental Java Concepts: Demonstrates the use of arrays, loops, conditional statements, and user input handling in Java, making it a 
great learning resource for beginners.

Educational Purpose: Ideal for students and beginners in Java programming, offering a practical example of how a simple banking system 
can be implemented.

Open for Enhancement: The repository invites contributions to expand functionalities, improve code efficiency, and implement the pending 
features like account search, deposit, and withdrawal operations.

Java-BankingSystem-Simulator is a perfect starting point for those interested in understanding how banking software might be structured 
and developed using basic Java programming concepts. Join in to learn, contribute, and expand on this foundational banking system simulation!
